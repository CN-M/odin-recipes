    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        Cranberries and orange are a natural pairing, and I wanted to combine them in a cheesecake fit for the Thanksgiving table. The cranberry glaze is a really beautiful color, and the sugared cranberries are the perfect topping. Most of the work is done the night before, so it's not even that hard to make.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>10 digestive biscuits (such as McVitie's®)</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>¼ cup sour cream</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 orange, zested </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease the sides of a 9-inch springform pan. Line the bottom with a circle of parchment paper.</li>
        
        Crush biscuits into crumbs using a food processor. Stir crumbs, butter, confectioners' sugar, and salt together to make the crust. Press into the bottom of the pan. Rinse food processor and set aside for the cranberry glaze.
        Step 3
        
        Bake crust in the preheated oven until firm, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the crust from the oven and reduce the temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Let crust cool while making the filling.
        Step 4
        
        Beat cream cheese and sugar together until smooth. Add eggs, sour cream, vanilla, and orange zest. Mix until well combined, stopping to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl. Spoon batter over the crust.
        
    </ol>
